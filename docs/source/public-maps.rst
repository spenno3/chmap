Public Maps

This feature provides a list that contains 300+ public maps collected by
the CHMap project.

To explore the public maps, click on “Public maps” at the top of the

displaying all public map layers collected by the CHMap project, or
filtering to a smaller collection (by place name or by a latitude and
longitude).
