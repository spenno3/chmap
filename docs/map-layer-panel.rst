Using the Map Layer Panel
-------------------------

Base Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Base layers are the map onto which you will project your data. You can
change the base layer by clicking on the checkbox next to the layer you
wish to use. Only one of these can be selected at a time.

Over-layers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Over-layers will be pasted as an additional layer on top of the base
layer. To choose an over layer, click on the checkbox next to the layer
you wish to use. Unlike the base layers, there is no limit to the number
of over-layers displayed at one time.

Copy Tileset URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To copy the tileset URL of an over-layer, click on the clipboard icon
with the “+” directly to the right of the layer title. This will copy
the tileset URL to the clipboard of your device which can then be pasted
into another window.

Move Map to This Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pin icon (to the right of the clipboard icon) will center the view
over the location of the over-layer.

The CHMap application also allows you to add your own layers sourced
from another website or your own research. To add an external layer,
click on the blue “+” next to “Your Layers.”
